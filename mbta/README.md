1) What has/hasn't been implemented correctly

2) I used many online and provided sources to learn more about the APIs and other specifics with the assignment:
	- I used much of the provided Google Maps Geolocation example to get most of the information and syntax on basic google maps features
	- I used this Google guide to learn how to create the markers with the T symbol on them: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/custom-markers
	- I used this similar Google guide to create infowindows: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/infowindows
	- I used yet another Google guide for polylines: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polyline-simple
	- I used the Haversine formula from this post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript

3) I spent about 8 hours on this assignment.
