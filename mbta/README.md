1) Most of the program has been implemented correctly. However, after parsing the JSON data, I had extreme trouble understanding how to read and access it, so, as a result, the infowindows do not display the departures and direction.

2) I used many online and provided sources to learn more about the APIs and other specifics with the assignment:
	- I used much of the provided Google Maps Geolocation example to get most of the information and syntax on basic google maps features
	- I used this Google guide to learn how to create the markers with the T symbol on them: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/custom-markers
	- I used this similar Google guide to create infowindows: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/infowindows
	- I used yet another Google guide for polylines: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polyline-simple
	- I used the Haversine formula from this post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript

3) I spent about 8 hours on this assignment, and would have likely spent more if I had not run out of time.
