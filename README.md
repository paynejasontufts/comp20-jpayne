README for COMP20
Name: Jason Payne

1) What is this purpose of this Git repository?
	The purpose of this repository is to privately contain most of the programs
		written in COMP20 in a single, organized folder.

2) What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
	While the end result was not necessarily pretty, Assignment One was my
		favorite to do. Creating a finished product that was public,
		informative, and ultimately useful felt like the quintessence of the
		class. I enjoyed creating the page, and with the other skills I
		learned later in the class, I believe I could make a page that I 
		would feel confident displaying to others. 

3) How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
	I believe that I have grown a lot. As my only previous computer science
		experience was COMP11, I had almost no sense of how to practically
		use computer science in the world at large. Additionally, this class
		forced me to learn how to use a wide variety of useful langauges and 
		enviornments that I otherwise would have been blind to, as well as how
		to search for information myself. 

4) What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
	I believe the most important thing I have learned in this course is how 
		the web works as a whole, both on the abstract level (request/response)
		and on the more direct level (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Before this class,
		I had little to no idea about either of those. Even the the very short
		time I've had this knowledge, it has been very useful both in and out 
		of class. I've been able to follow more news and topic discussions
		regarding the internet and web programming, where as before, I didn't
		have enough information to understand. Additionally, when looking for
		jobs in the near future, I can more easily consider web programming as
		an option, especially with the technical tools I've gained over the 
		semester.

5) Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
	I would most like to delve more into security. It's one of the most
		important, if not the most important, issue in modern computing, so 
		being able to understand and interact with those issues is becoming 
		essential. Additionally, since much of the computer science world does
		not understand as much as they should about security, any knowledge I
		have about the topic would likely help me greatly in the future.
