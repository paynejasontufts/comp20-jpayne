1) All of the work is correctly implemented according to the spec. 

2) I drew heavy inspiration from the Double Rainbow HTML, as well as syntax from the provided pages on the .addEventListener function.

3) I spent about two hours on this project, though about an hour of that was due to a minor but frustrating syntax error that I had trouble pinpointing.
