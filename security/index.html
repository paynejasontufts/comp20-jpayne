	<h1>Security Review</h1>
	<h3 id="name">By Jason Payne</h3>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>This document is a web security review for the 2048 Game Server app 
	created by Ming Chow. The app, hosted on heroku at 
	"https://gameserver2048.herokuapp.com/", displays scores for the popular
	game app 2048. It can also call up JSON data given a specific username.
	In this report, I will be exploiting and reviewing the security and privacy
	issues that exist in the app.</p>

	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>To go about testing, my main methods were using query strings and using
	curl to send data to the server. In terms of query strings, I simply 
	changed different variables and values in the query string based on the 
	results I wanted with operators. For curl, I sent in data that may have
	been invalid through the 2048 game, such as high scores, empty grids, and
	unrestrained usernames. Additionally, I also used a shell script to create
	an infinite loop of requests to the server, though the loop did not run 
	for long.</p>

	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
	<p>Overall, I identified three major security and privacy errors in the
	application: first, the client can input new JavaScript into the app, 
	allowing them to manipulate the page in a near infinite number of ways.
	Second, the client can manipulate input data such that they can access
	the raw data of every single username without even needing to know them.
	Finally, there is no restriction to the number of input requests that can
	be sent from a single user at once, meaning that the client can overload
	the database and stop any further input.</p>

	<h2>Issues Found</h2>
	<h3>Issue 1: Cross-Site Scripting in Username Input</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="Point">Issue:</span> The client can input a JavaScript 
		string into the "username" field. As a result, the client can create 
		instances of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing them to do just about 
		anything on the app. To show this weakness, I merely created an alert 
		box to show the problem, but there are far more dangerous applications, 
		if the problem is unchecked. </li>
		<li><span class="Point">Location:</span> This issue exists in the 
		username aspect of the data, meaning that it effects the GET "/" 
		page. The origin of this problem can originate from either curl or 
		the 2048 game page.</li>
		<li><span class="Point">Severity:</span> High Severity. This issue 
		allows the client to control almost anything about the webpage, as 
		JavaScript can control any HTML or the data.</li>
		<li><span class="Point">Description:</span> This XSS vulnerability, as 
		stated above, allows the client to insert JavaScript into the page, 
		letting them do almost whatever they want. Suspected the error when I 
		saw that there were no tests to the input that I could funnel into the 
		database. When I tested the alert, as shown below, I knew that XSS was 
		a major flaw in the security of the application.</li>
		<li><span class="Point">Proof of Vulnerability:</span></li>
		<img src="curl_sent.png" alt="A terminal with a successful curl response with JavaScript code in the username" class="image">
		<img src="breach_alert.png" alt="An alert box with the message 'This is a breach" class="image">
		<li><span class="Point">Resolution:</span> To solve this problem, you 
		can simply strip all special characters from the username after it is 
		inserted. A single line of JavaScript in the /submit can fix this: 
		'username:'username.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, '')</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Issue 2: Access to All Data</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="Point">Issue:</span> By adding a modifier to the query
		string in scores.json, the client can access all data in the database, 
		regardless of their own username. This is accomplished through adding 
		"[$ne]" in the query string, leading to the database returning all data
		that is not equal to the given username. This is a major breach of 
		privacy.</li>
		<li><span class="Point">Location:</span> This problem is located in 
		the GET "/scores.json" path. Specifically, it occurs in the query 
		string portion of the function, when the query string is passed
		to the database without being checked at all.</li>
		<li><span class="Point">Severity:</span> Medium severity. While this is 
		not necessarily dangerous in this application, due to most of the data 
		already being public on the main page, this issue still causes a major
		privacy breach, as anyone can access any data. </li>
		<li><span class="Point">Description:</span> As stated above, this 
		issue occurs when someone adds a MongoDB search modifier to the query
		string, specifically the [$ne] operator. I found this issue when I 
		realized that there was parsing of the query string before it was sent
		to search the database. My test is shown below, where I found a username
		with no data corresponding to it, and revealed all stored data by using
		the mentioned operator.</li>
		<li><span class="Point">Proof of Vulnerability:</span></li>
		<img src="all_data_shown.png" alt="A large amount of JSON data, with a [$ne] in the query string" class="image">
		<li><span class="Point">Resolution:</span> This problem can be solved
		through a number of different ways, though one rather simple one is
		authenification. By creating a password or other form of 
		authenification for each username, the client can still access their 
		data while still maintaining their privacy.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Issue 3: Infinite Requests</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="Point">Issue:</span> There is no limit to the number
		of input requests a single person can send to the server in a given 
		amount of time, allowing someone to send an unlimited number of 
		requests. While the server will most likely be able to handle this,
		MongoDB eventually has a limit to the amount of data it can hold in
		a single database. This means that until the database is cleared, it
		will not accept any new data, and it is likely that valuable data could
		be stored in the deleted data, causing problems for normal clients.</li>
		<li><span class="Point">Location:</span> This issue exists in the
		post path, though its results can be seen in either of the get paths. 
		Eventually, it will cause the database to no longer accept new data
		from the post /submit path.</li>
		<li><span class="Point">Severity:</span> Low severity. While this issue
		is irritating and inconvient most of the time, it can be easily fixed
		after the fact and, if handled properly, will likely not result in any
		breaches of privacy or integrity.</li>
		<li><span class="Point">Description:</span> As previously mentioned,
		this error occurs when someone runs an (or several) infinite loop(s)
		sending data to the server. I found this issue when automating my 
		testing, resulting in my realization that there was nothing stopping
		me from overloading the database. As pictured below, I wrote an infinite
		loop in shell script, and ran it for a short time to test that it 
		worked. In the interest of time and redundency, I did not run the loop
		long enough to fill the database.</li>
		<li><span class="Point">Proof of Vulnerability:</span></li>
		<img src="shell_loop.png" alt="Four lines of shell script creating an infinite loop of curl requests" class="image">
		<img src="repeated_data.png" alt="Many lines of the same data that was sent to the server in the previous image" class="image">
		<li><span class="Point">Resolution:</span> To resolve this issue, you
		can limit the number of requests sent in by a single person. The 
		simplest way to do this is likely to limit the number of entries from
		a single username, or to create authentification that is necessary to
		send requests, resulting in a limited number of requests per person.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>As mentioned in each section, all of the exposed problems have 
	relatively simple fixes in this application that are outlined above. 
	In the future, it would be wise to never trust anything the client can 
	send, whether it be curled, unlimited strings, query strings, or the sheer
	number of requests a client can send. By restricting client manuverability,
	the integrity and privacy of the website or app can be greatly improved.</p>
