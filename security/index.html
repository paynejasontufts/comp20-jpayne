	<h1>Security Review</h1>
	<h3 id="name">By Jason Payne</h3>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>This document is a web security review for the 2048 Game Server app 
	created by Ming Chow. The app, hosted on heroku at 
	"https://gameserver2048.herokuapp.com/", displays scores for the popular
	game app 2048. It can also call up JSON data given a specific username.
	In this report, I will be exploiting and reviewing the security and privacy
	issues that exist in the app.</p>

	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>An Overview of all security and privacy issues identified in lay language</p>

	<h2>Issues Found</h2>
	<h3>Issue 1: XSS in Username Input</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="Point">Issue:</span> The client can input a JavaScript 
		string into the "username" field. As a result, the client can create 
		instances of Cross-Site Scripting, allowing them to do just about 
		anything on the app. To show this weakness, I merely created an alert 
		box to show the problem, but there are far more dangerous applications, 
		if the problem is unchecked. </li>
		<li><span class="Point">Location:</span> This issue exists in the 
		username aspect of the data, meaning that it effects the GET "/" 
		page. The origin of this problem can originate from either curl or 
		the 2048 game page.</li>
		<li><span class="Point">Severity:</span> High Severity. This issue 
		allows the client to control almost anything about the webpage, as 
		JavaScript can control any HTML or the data.</li>
		<li><span class="Point">Description:</span> This XSS vulnerability, as 
		stated above, allows the client to insert JavaScript into the page, 
		letting them do almost whatever they want. Suspected the error when I 
		saw that there were no tests to the input that I could funnel into the 
		database. When I tested the alert, as shown below, I knew that XSS was 
		a major flaw in the security of the application.</li>
		<li><span class="Point">Proof of Vulnerability:</span></li>
		<img src="curl_sent.png" alt="A terminal with a successful curl response with JavaScript code in the username" class="image">
		<img src="breach_alert.png" alt="An alert box with the message 'This is a breach" class="image">
		<li><span class="Point">Resolution:</span> To solve this problem, you 
		can simply strip all special characters from the username after it is 
		inserted. A single line of JavaScript can fix this: ""</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Issue 2: Access to All Data</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="Point">Issue:</span> </li>
		<li><span class="Point">Location:</span></li>
		<li><span class="Point">Severity:</span></li>
		<li><span class="Point">Description:</span></li>
		<li><span class="Point">Proof of Vulnerability:</span></li>
		<img src="all_data_shown.png" alt="A large amount of JSON data, with a [$ne] in the query string" class="image">
		<li><span class="Point">Resolution:</span></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Issue 3: </h3>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="Point">Issue:</span> </li>
		<li><span class="Point">Location:</span></li>
		<li><span class="Point">Severity:</span></li>
		<li><span class="Point">Description:</span></li>
		<li><span class="Point">Proof of Vulnerability:</span></li>
		<li><span class="Point">Resolution:</span></li>
	</ul>
